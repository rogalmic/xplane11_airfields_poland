# Airfields Poland

Project contains some western Poland's airfields I created when having fun with Xplane - mostly small and very small unpaved runways...

Edit and deploy to xplane with [XPLANE WED](https://developer.x-plane.com/tools/worldeditor/):
- install XPlane 11 (if not done already)
- go to XP11 folder, copy "A_PL_Airports" to "Custom Scenery" folder
- open WED and select XP11 folder
- open "A_PL_Airports"
- select export target as XPlane 11 from file menu
- click export scenery pack from file menu
